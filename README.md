# Tessellation Graph Local

Tessellation Graph Local is a Go-based CLI tool for ov-tessellation.

## Getting Started

The root directory should contain a file called `graph-local`. Execute this file to run the command.

> [!WARNING]  
> FEATURE: This may have permission issues. Should we include building and running the executable in the documentation?

```sh
./graph-local
```

If have go installed, you can use `go run main.go` to run the program or `go build` to recreate the executable.
